# defun

A macro to define clojure functions with pattern matching just as erlang or elixir. It supports both clojure and clojurescript.

## Usage

Dependency in leiningen:

``` clj
    [defun "0.4.0"]
```

### Basic usage

Require `defun.core` in clojure:

```clj
(require '[defun.core :refer [defun]])
```

Or `refer-macros` in clojurescript:

```cljs
(ns cljs-test
  (:require  [defun.core :refer-macros [defun]])
(enable-console-print!)
```

Try to define function just like `defn`:

``` clj
(defun hello
   "hello world"
   [name] (str "hello," name))
(hello "defun")
;; "hello,defun"
```

Supports variadic arguments, doc, metadata etc. as `defun` too. No surprises?

The fun thing is coming, let's say hi to people:

``` clj
(defun say-hi
  ([:dennis] "Hi,good morning, dennis.")
  ([:catty] "Hi, catty, what time is it?")
  ([:green] "Hi,green, what a good day!")
  ([other] (str "Say hi to " other)))
```

Then calling `say-hi` with different names:

``` clj
(say-hi :dennis)
;;  "Hi,good morning, dennis."
(say-hi :catty)
;;  "Hi, catty, what time is it?"
(say-hi :green)
;;  "Hi,green, what a good day!"
(say-hi "someone")
;;  "Say hi to someone"
```

We define functions just like Erlang's function with parameters pattern match (thanks to [core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match)), we don't need `if,cond,case` any more, that's cool!

### Recursion

Let's move on, what about define a recursive function? That's easy too:

``` clj
(defun count-down
  ([0] (println "Reach zero!"))
  ([n] (println n)
     (recur (dec n))))
```

Invoke it:

``` clj
(count-down 5)
;;5
;;4
;;3
;;2
;;1
;;Reach zero!
nil
```

An accumulator from zero to number `n`:

``` clj
(defun accum
  ([0 ret] ret)
  ([n ret] (recur (dec n) (+ n ret)))
  ([n] (recur n 0)))

(accum 100)
;;5050
```

A fibonacci function:

``` clj
(defun fib
    ([0] 0)
    ([1] 1)
    ([n] (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))
```

Output:

``` clj
(fib 10)
;; 55
```

Of course it's not tail recursive, but it's really cool, isn't it?

### Guards

Added a guard function to parameters:

``` clj
(defun funny
  ([(N :guard #(= 42 %))] true)
  ([_] false))

(funny 42)
;;  true
(funny 43)
;; false
```

Another function to detect if longitude and latitude values are both valid:

``` clj
(defun valid-geopoint?
    ([(_ :guard #(and (> % -180) (< % 180)))
      (_ :guard #(and (> % -90) (< % 90)))] true)
    ([_ _] false))

(valid-geopoint? 30 30)
;; true
(valid-geopoint? -181 30)
;; false
```

### Private defun

Of course, you can use `defun-` to define a function that is private just as `defn-`

### More Patterns

In fact ,the above `say-hi` function will be expanded to be:

``` clj
(defn
 say-hi
 {:arglists '([& args])}
 [& args#]
 (clojure.core.match/match
  [(vec args#)]
  [[:dennis]]
  (do "Hi,good morning, dennis.")
  [[:catty]]
  (do "Hi, catty, what time is it?")
  [[:green]]
  (do "Hi,green, what a good day!")
  [[other]]
  (do (str "Say hi to " other))))
```

The argument vector is in fact a pattern in core.match, so we can use all patterns that supported by [core.match](https://github.com/clojure/core.match/wiki/Basic-usage).

For example, matching literals

``` clj
(defun test1
    ([true false] 1)
    ([true true] 2)
    ([false true] 3)
    ([false false] 4))

(test1 true true)
;; 2
(test1 false false)
;; 4
```

Matching sequence:

``` clj
(defun test2
    ([([1] :seq)] :a0)
    ([([1 2] :seq)] :a1)
    ([([1 2 nil nil nil] :seq)] :a2))

(test2 [1 2 nil nil nil])
;; a2
```

Matching vector:

``` clj
(defun test3
    ([[_ _ 2]] :a0)
    ([[1 1 3]] :a1)
    ([[1 2 3]] :a2))

(test3 [1 2 3])
;; :a2
```

Rest Pattern, Map Pattern, Or Pattern etc.

I don't want to copy the [core.match's wiki](https://github.com/clojure/core.match/wiki/Basic-usage),please visit it by yourself.

### fun and letfun

``` clojure
((fun
    ([[_ _ 2]] :a0)
    ([[1 1 3]] :a1)
    ([[1 2 3]] :a2))
  [1 2 3])
;; :a2

(letfun [(test3 ([[_ _ 2]] :a0)
                    ([[1 1 3]] :a1)
                    ([[1 2 3]] :a2))]
  (test3 [1 2 3]))
;; :a2
```



## Criterium benchmarking

Uses the above function `accum` compared with a normal clojure function:

``` clj
(require '[criterium.core :refer [bench]])

(defn accum-defn
    ([n] (accum-defn 0 n))
    ([ret n] (if (= n 0) ret (recur (+ n ret) (dec n)))))

(defun accum-defun
  ([0 ret] ret)
  ([n ret] (recur (dec n) (+ n ret)))
  ([n] (recur n 0)))

(bench (accum-defn 10000))
;;Evaluation count : 106740 in 60 samples of 1779 calls.
;;             Execution time mean : 578.777537 µs
;;    Execution time std-deviation : 23.354350 µs
;;   Execution time lower quantile : 552.627735 µs ( 2.5%)
;;   Execution time upper quantile : 637.001868 µs (97.5%)
;;                   Overhead used : 17.111650 ns

(bench (accum-defun 10000))
;;Evaluation count : 54660 in 60 samples of 911 calls.
;;             Execution time mean : 1.115643 ms
;;    Execution time std-deviation : 32.916487 µs
;;   Execution time lower quantile : 1.078117 ms ( 2.5%)
;;   Execution time upper quantile : 1.180711 ms (97.5%)
;;                   Overhead used : 17.111650 ns
```

accum-defn is faster than accum-defun. Pattern matching does have a tradeoff.
